# Templates for cracking code challenges

When you get a code challange (from [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/) or hackerrank), when the adrenaline is kicking in, you should be ready.

Supported: [Java](ProjectTemplate_Java/) and [Python](ProjectTemplate_Python/):

1. Continuous test runners,

2. Test templates with timeouts,

3. Libraries included that could help you, e.g., ipython for the python project,

4. A command to call linter included. Just before the final submit to make the code look nicer if needed.
